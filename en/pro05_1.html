            <h1>China Practice</h1>
            <p>
              Over the past few decades, China has rapidly evolved from a plain manufacturing center to one of the major world markets.  Investments in China therefore have been developed into various types in order to meet the transformation of the China economy and the clients' changing needs.  Different Chinese authorities, from the central government to local administrations, also promulgated an array of codes and guidelines to regulate foreign investments, labor protections, tax incentives and dispute resolutions.  Under this trend, the lawyer's role gradually shifted from a litigator to a leading member of the transactional planning team.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other side, foreign countries also passed laws and regulations aiming to control and monitor the inbound flow from gigantic Chinese investments.  Taking Taiwan as an example, facing the rapidly grown giant it has promulgated two major regulations: &quot;Act Governing Relations between the People of Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area&quot; and &quot;Guidelines for Mainland Area People's Investments in Taiwan.&quot;  Under these two regulations, a Chinese investment in Taiwan requires prior approvals from Taiwan authorizes so long as it falls in the definitions of &quot;Chinese Fund&quot; and &quot;Investment in Taiwan.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;Chinese Fund&quot; includes any entity established in China (&quot;China Entity&quot;) or any offshore entity that has China Entity investment.  An offshore entity would be deemed as having China Entity investment if such China Entity, directly or indirectly, holds more than 30% of the equity of such offshore entity, or has control over such offshore entity.  &quot;Investment in China&quot; includes (i) holding shares of a Taiwan entity, (ii) establishing a branch in Taiwan, or (iii) providing a mid-term or long-term loan to an entity or a branch described in (i) or (ii) above.  Therefore, Taiwan authorities take a broad definition in terms of &quot;China Entity&quot; but a rather narrow definition of &quot;Investment in Taiwan.&quot;  It provides an experienced lawyer enough leeway to structure a deal that is both feasible and lawful.<br />
              To achieve its clients' goals, THLK Partners continues to accompany its clients throughout the different stages of legal schemes and represent the clients in communicating with government authorities facing irregular and uncertain implementations of relevant regulations and subtle rules.
