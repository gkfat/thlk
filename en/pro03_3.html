            <h1>International Dispute Resolution</h1>
            <p>
              As Taiwan is an export-oriented small economy, import and export trade is always one of the most important commercial activities in Taiwan.  Together with the globalization of commercial activities, there emerge more and more cross-border commercial disputes as well.  Specifically, cross-border litigation consists of two major categories: &quot;out-bound litigation&quot; and &quot;in-bound litigation&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, Taiwan companies might not necessarily have experience in cooperating with local lawyers in the foreign countries where they have established commercial presence.  Thus, when such Taiwanese company is involved in lawsuit in a foreign country (out-bound litigation), typically it is difficult to find a competent local lawyer.  Also, in some countries, the quality of legal services varies considerably from one law firm to another.  Thus, many Taiwanese companies spend costs and attorney's legal fees but do not obtain reasonable outcomes.  THLK Partners' broad network of relationships with law firms throughout the world enables the firm to assist Taiwan-based clients with their matters in other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              As to the in-bound litigation initiated by foreign companies, Taiwanese lawyers' involvement is necessary since foreign companies are generally unfamiliar with Taiwanese laws and dispute resolution system.  Some local firms in Taiwan, however, are incapable of performing satisfactorily due to language constraints and/or cultural barriers.  Also, in cross-border dispute cases, if the lawyer cannot consume the massive volume of documents in foreign language in a professional and timely manner and select relevant information for the clients, the time-consuming procedure would be a waste of the clients' costs.  Even worse, the clients might not be able to obtain satisfactory outcomes in such procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our lawyers are not only admitted to practice laws in several jurisdictions (e.g. Taiwan, New York State and California State etc.), but also work on close collaboration with highly regarded local law firms throughout the world.
