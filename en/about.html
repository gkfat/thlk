        <h1>The concept and model of &quot;boutique law firm&quot;</h1>
        <p>
          It has been a prevailing phenomenon in the Taiwan legal service market that the service quality varies greatly with the different sizes of law firms.  Big law firms, albeit their ample man power and relatively stable staff quality, charge a higher fee which most small-and-medium size enterprises and individuals could not afford.  On top of that, big law firms tend to respond less promptly as a result of their typically heavy workload.  On the other hand, small law firms, notwithstanding their relatively lower fee rate, are forced to confine their businesses to traditional practice areas of civil, criminal and administrative litigations due to a lack of experience in cross-border deals and significant domestic transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of this, Sean Tung, Eric Hsu and Marx Lai, sophisticated attorneys who had been practicing law in major law firms and/or global corporations in Taiwan for years, decided to make a breakthrough against the grain by introducing the concept and model of “boutique law firm” into the Taiwan legal service market and establishing THLK Partners in Taipei.

          The transcription of THLK Partners’ Chinese name is Hai He.  “Hai” (海) means “ocean”, symbolizing our attorneys’ diverse backgrounds as well as global thinking and experience, whereas “He” (禾) means “grain”, with a deep connection to the land, symbolizing the locality of the operation and application of laws whereby local attorneys are best suited to provide domestic and foreign clients with quality services addressing their needs.  These two words combined poignantly deliver the idea and spirit of “global thinking. local service.” championed by THLK Partners.

        <h1>Quality services appreciated by clients and professional institutions</h1>
        <p>
          THLK Partners is staffed with professionals specialized in diverse practice areas covering litigation, corporate investments, securities transactions, asset management, real estate, competition law and merger and acquisition, etc.  With attorneys licensed in Taiwan and the US, we strive to provide domestic and foreign clients with comprehensive legal services of best quality.  The quality of THLK Partners’ services and performances has been appreciated by domestic and foreign clients, institutional and individual alike, and in recent years we have got into the ranking tables by several international prestigious rating agencies. For instance, we were recognized by the 2013 Corporate Intl Magazine Legal Award as “Full Service Law Firm of the Year in Taiwan”. In 2017, we were ranked by International Financial Law Review (IFLR 1000) as “notable firm” in M&A and Capital Markets. Based on Bloomberg M&A Market Review Legal Rankings of 2017, we were ranked as No.4 in terms of Taiwan deal numbers among all the law firms (including law firms of Taiwan, Mainland China and others).  Nevertheless, such honor would not stop us from ever progressing.  We will continue to not only expand the scope of our practice areas, but refine our services and beef up our efficiency with a view to satisfactorily addressing client needs.
