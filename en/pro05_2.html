            <h1>Foreign Direct Investment</h1>
            <p>
              As a small island country whose economy hinges upon import/export trading, Taiwan has been heavily relying on injection of foreign capitals for its economic developments over the past few decades.  So as early as in 1954, Taiwan promulgated the Statute For Investment By Foreign Nationals, with its restrictions being gradually loosened over time so as to induce foreign capital inflows to promote domestic economic development and bolster employment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the current laws and regulations, Taiwan adopts the &quot;approval regime&quot; for foreigners' investment activities; however, the &quot;negative list&quot; approach is adopted for prohibited or restricted items for foreign investments.  The steps for foreigners applying for investments in Taiwan include the following, in sequence: applying with the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Economic Affairs (&quot;MOEA&quot;) for reservation of company name and business scope, applying with the Investment Commission, MOEA for foreign investment approval, remitting in capital, applying with the Investment Commission, MOEA for capital verification and approval and applying with the Department of Commerce, MOEA (where paid-in capital is at or above TWD500 million) or with the Central Office, MOEA or the applicable municipal governments (where paid-in capital is below TWD500 million) for company registration.

              Our lawyers have been assisting foreign corporate clients with their investment activities in Taiwan, and our extensive experience ranges from straightforward office establishment (subsidiary, branch or representative office) to complicated cross-border acquisitions and mergers.  In particular, if the foreign client's investment involves any special-licensed enterprise (for instance, the foreign client applies for establishing a financial institution in Taiwan), we can offer one-stop services and assist the client with obtaining the various approvals required.
