            <h1>Litigation</h1>
            <p>
              With the development of business transaction models comes the diversification and complication of litigation cases.  The traditional demarcation among civil, criminal and administrative litigation cases gradually develop into more refined and specialized categories.  As opposed to traditional civil or criminal litigation cases, those related to the Company Act, the Securities and Exchange Act, the Securities Investment Trust and Consulting Act and the Futures and Exchange Act require not only a command of the relevant regulations and rules, but also professional knowledge and abundant experiences in the day-to-day corporate business, stock trading, operation of capital market and accounting rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Distinct from those common small-size law firms whose experience and capacity is confined to traditional litigation cases, we integrate the resources and knowledge from both the litigation department and the corporate department so as to better address client needs and formulate the optimal litigation strategy.  In addition to the common civil and criminal litigation cases and administrative appeals, we are also capable of handling sophisticated litigations for financial institutions.  We have represented prestigious clients, as plaintiff or as defendant, in many major commercial lawsuits, including those involving contests of company control, merger and acquisition disputes, financial statement fraud, insider trading, stock manipulation, breach of trust or embezzlement under the Securities and Exchange Act, etc.
