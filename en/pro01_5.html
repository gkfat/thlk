            <h1>Asset Management</h1>
            <p>
              With the maturing of economy, the asset management industry comes to play a vital role in the financial market.  On the one hand, asset managers make investment decisions for a broad base of investors (the fund business and the discretionary asset management business) or provide investment advices (the securities investment consulting business); on the other hand, they act as institutional investors of significant relevance in the capital markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the legal framework of Taiwan, the asset management industry refers to the two special-licensed enterprises: securities investment trust enterprises (SITE) and securities investment consulting enterprises (SICE), regulated under Taiwan's Securities Investment Trust and Consulting Act.  Their licensed businesses include the offering and sale of onshore funds (i.e., securities investment trust funds) and offshore funds, the discretionary asset management business (the so-called &quot;separate accounts&quot;) and securities investment consulting business.
