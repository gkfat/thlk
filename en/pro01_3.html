            <h1>Financial Regulation</h1>
            <p>
              Regulation on financial institutions in Taiwan is divided into the three major categories of special-licensed enterprises: banks, insurance companies and securities and futures enterprises (which can be further categorized into securities firms, bill houses, futures enterprises and securities investment trust and consulting enterprises), regulated by the Banking Bureau, the Insurance Bureau and the Securities and Futures Bureau, respectively.  On top of that, the Financial Examination Bureau is responsible for inspecting the financial institutions' businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Financial laws and regulations have become more relaxed over the past years in Taiwan, and gradually financial institutions of one industry are allowed to concurrently conduct business in another industry.  This development provides the enterprises with more flexibilities and opportunities for innovation on the one hand, but it also presents new challenges on the other hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Against such backdrop, it has become very critical for the financial institutions, confronted with fierce competition with peers, to properly address the various legal and compliance issues (such as conflicts of interest and protection of client rights) arising from concurrently conducting businesses across multiple industries.   Our lawyers are not only adept in the financial laws and regulations, but well-experienced in dealing with various delicate issues in practice.  To sum up, THLK Partners provides the following services in the area of financial regulation:
