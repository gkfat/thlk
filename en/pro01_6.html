            <h1>Securitization</h1>
            <p>
              As a financial instrument of innovation, securitization is aimed at packaging a bunch of illiquid but stable-income-generating assets (such as commercial properties, housing loans, banks loans to enterprises, accounts receivables, etc.) and issuing securities backed by such packaged assets.  In other words, securitization is a financial instrument for creating or enhancing liquidity, so it can add investment options for investors as well as diversity investment risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the promulgation of the Financial Asset Securitization Act in 2002 and the Real Estate Securitization Act in 2003, the securitization market in Taiwan has been in rapid growth, with various types of securitization products being created in practice.  These products include: in terms of the assets to be securitized, commercial properties, retail stores, warehouses, housing loans, bank loans to enterprises, enterprises' accounts receivable, leases receivable, bonds, preferred stock, etc.; in terms of the asset-backed securities to be issued, those without a maturity date (such as Real Estate Investment Trust, &quot;REIT&quot;) and those with a maturity date, those whose duration is more than one year and those whose duration is below one year and thus to be issued on a revolving basis (i.e., Asset Backed Commercial Paper, &quot;ABCP&quot;).
            </p>
