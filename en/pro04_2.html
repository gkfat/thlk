            <h1>Real Estate Transaction and Dispute</h1>
            <p>
              Due to its high value, real estate has always been a main investment target for the retail public and for the institutional investors, leading to a dynamic transaction market.  However, the regulations on real estate are voluminous and tedious, and transaction types are rather diverse: in terms of the transaction target, it includes residential properties, commercial properties, retail stores, warehouses, factories, etc.; in terms of transaction model, it includes sale (financed or non-financed sale), gift, trust, co-development, creation of real rights for security and usufructuary rights, urban renewal, etc. for residential properties, and for commercial properties it even extends to cover bid sale, auction, sale and lease back, real estate securitization (including entrustment at the beginning and liquidation at the end), project development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different transaction targets and transaction models involve, during or after the transaction, different legal issues (such as warranties, the validity of notwithstanding title transfer, &quot;bankruptcy remoteness&quot; of entrusted assets).  These case-specific legal issues are precisely where disputes, and even lawsuits, might arise.  Without guidance from a professional lawyer at the time of a transaction or a lawsuit, people would be at a loss as to how claim or defend their own interests, thereby incurring a loss of huge property interests.  In a nutshell, an excellent and professional legal counsel on real estate has to be one very adept in the various types of real estate transactions and with a good command in the their characteristics which vary from case to case.  Such legal counsel further regards the whole real estate transaction as a vibrant and ever-changing process with a view to properly assessing and mitigating the related risks beforehand and thereby protecting clients' rights and interests.

              In urban renewal cases, for instance, land lots in the urban areas are so scarce that it is almost impossible for construction companies to find a land lot which is uncomplicated in its ownership, complete and large enough for development.  Moreover, the urban areas are dotted with buildings which are decades old and thus already outdated in terms of design and resistance against earthquakes, and these buildings' outlook might have already been peeling off, thus in urgent need of re-construction or renovation.  Thus is born the need from construction companies and landowners for urban renewal.  Nevertheless, despite its necessity for systematically re-developing and utilizing urban land lots, rehabilitating urban functions, improving living environment and furthering public interests, it involves interests sharing between the construction company and the landowner as well as complicated legal procedures and issues (for instance, the designation of urban renewal areas, the difference between &quot;agreed co-development&quot; and &quot;rights transformation&quot; in terms of implementation of urban renewal, the difference between business summary and business plan, the acquisition and allocation of voting rights and building dimension rewards, the approval on rights values and rights transformation plan, the calculation of common sharing, the handling of illegal constructions, etc.) which, if not handled properly, could lead to a dispute and even a strike against or a halt of the whole urban renewal case, an undesirable development for the construction company and the landowner.  Therefore, a professional lawyer plays a crucial role in establishing mutual trust between the construction company and the landowner, securing the interested parties' rights and creating a win-win situation throughout the urban renewal process.
