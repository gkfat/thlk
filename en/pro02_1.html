              M&amp;A transactions always involve complicated and diversified legal issues.  In general, the dynamics of an M&amp;A transaction includes target choosing, due diligence, transaction structuring, pricing, determination of consideration, drafting, negotiation, execution, and performance of agreements, closing and post-transaction integration.  Each section in the procedure is correlated, and involves different laws/regulations and supervision and oversight by competent authorities.

            <p>
              Also, depending on the parties' needs in different deals, the M&amp;A transaction structure varies, which includes shares sales, tender offer, new shares subscription, share swap, assets sales, general assumption of rights and obligations, merger, spin-off, and many other options.  Hence, when planning the deal structure, an experienced M&amp;A lawyer should take into consideration the client's position (buyer side or seller side), nature of industry (highly-regulated or not), nature of target (public or privately-owned), transaction purpose (back door listing or going-private) and many other factors.  THLK Partners has accumulated cutting-edge know-how by engaging in many of the largest and most complex M&amp;A transactions in Taiwan, which enables our lawyers to propose a structure which satisfies the clients' needs and complies with relevant laws/regulations.

              On the other hand, labor issue is usually another key aspect in an M&amp;A deal as well.  Enterprises to an M&amp;A transactions generally look for synergies by integrating resources.  Thus, sometimes it would be necessary to downsize and reduce labor costs.  In such cases, employees' resistance might become one of the major hurdles to the M&amp;A deal.  THLK Partners has substantial experiences in providing legal advice for companies facing HR and employment issues in connection with M&amp;A transactions.
