            <h1>Structured Finance</h1>
            <p>
              Structured finance plays as a frontier role in the legal system.  It challenges the thousand-year old legal system by introducing pioneering financial products from asset-backed securities (ABS) and securitization products backed by accounts receivables or non-performing loans (NPL) to project finance and intellectual property securitized products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taking project finance as an example, from the very beginning of deal structuring, securitized asset design, securing credit rating, and finance planning, to the final stage of closing and offering of the financial products, the comprehensive and thorough assistance from experienced and thoughtful corporate lawyers not only ensures the successful closing of the projects but also helps eliminating potential legal risks following the closing.
            </p>
