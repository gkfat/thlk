            <h1>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h1>
            <p>
              The development of alternative dispute resolution (&ldquo;ADR&rdquo;) stemmed from the need for  reasonable allocation of judicial resources.   Its main purpose is to reduce the number of litigation cases submitted  to the court and allow the parties to resort to a non-litigation approach for  dispute resolution and save costs.   However, modern types of disputes tend to involve various professional  areas (such as construction disputes and financial products disputes with  banks, insurance companies and securities firms), so there is an increasing  appetite from the parties to resort to professionals outside the courtroom to  step in and resolve the disputes.  Thus,  the Code of Civil Procedure, the Arbitration Law, the Financial Consumer  Protection Act, the Township Mediation Rules, etc. have set forth different  ADRs.  How to select the most  advantageous and cost-efficient approach and formulate the most appropriate  strategy and guidelines under a specific ADR ultimately lies in the advice of a  professional lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our litigation lawyers have extensive experiences in arbitration and  mediation.  We assess litigation risks,  assist in collecting or preserving supporting evidences, analyze the pros and  cons of various ADRs and provide sophisticated advices for clients.
