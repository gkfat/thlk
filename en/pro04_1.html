            <h1>Real Estate Investment and Development</h1>
            <p>
              In the asset management industry, real estate investment and development is usually categorized as &quot;alternative investments&quot; owing to real estate's uniqueness as compared with other investment targets (such as stocks and bonds): on the one hand, the low liquidity of real estate renders impossible a vibrant secondary market, and real estate's locality makes it difficult for standardization, resulting in information non-transparency and asymmetry in the market; on the other hand, sophisticated investors can take advantage of these seemingly unfavorable characteristics for profiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demarcation between &quot;investment&quot; and &quot;development&quot; of real estate lies in the timing of capital injection: the former being after the completion of real estate whereas the latter being before that (in the practice in Taiwan, the completion of real estate is typically set at the time when the use license is obtained).  With respect to real estate investment, as the real estate has been completed (and it might even have stable income already, such as rentals) when the capital is injected, the investment risks are relatively small, and the investment objective is to &quot;continue to earn rental income&quot; and &quot;expect capital gains arising from disposal of real estate in the future&quot;.  With respect to real estate development, transaction models are more complicated (in terms of transaction parties, it can be a land owner's self-construction, a construction company's purchase of land for construction or the co-development between a land owner and a construction company; in terms of funding source, it can be self-funding by land owner or construction company, funding from banks loans, funding from a third party strategic investor; in terms of transaction structure, it can be a corporate model where a special purpose company is set up to own the real estate or a contractual model where a trust is created), and as the real estate has not been completed when the capital is injected, the investment risks are relatively high (e.g., the funds needed in a later stage fail to be injected, the real estate fails to generate the expected rental income or capital gains as a result of market fluctuation, etc.), but the potential returns tend to be higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              The promulgation of the Real Estate Securitization Act in 2003 has activated the real estate investment market as well as diversified the transaction models for real estate investment and development.  Under the framework of the Real Estate Securitization Act, real estate securitization is categorized into Real Estate Investment Trust (&quot;REIT&quot;) and Real Estate Asset Trust (&quot;REAT&quot;): the former, similar to mutual funds (named as securities investment trust funds in Taiwan), raises money from the public and then invests in various types of real estate with stable income (including commercial properties, retail stores and warehouses) (provided that development-type REIT is allowed to invest in the real estate which is still under development and thus does not have stable income), whereas the latter provides a new channel whereby the property owner may bypass banks and get financing directly from the capital market, activating the property owner's use of assets and providing an alternative investment choice for investors.
