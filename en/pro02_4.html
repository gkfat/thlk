            <h1>Competition/Antitrust</h1>
            <p>
              Recent amendments to the Taiwan Fair Trade Law (the &quot;TFTL&quot;) have increased penalties for serious violations (Article 41 of the TFTL), instituted a leniency system (Article 35-1 of the TFTL), and conferred power to the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (the &quot;TFTC&quot;) to conduct investigations into possible violations.  Along with many remarkable penalties imposed on cartel actions by the TFTC, these amendments have resulted in stricter enforcement of laws prohibiting anticompetitive behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, in addition to investing in R&amp;D, seeking for technology innovation and breakthrough, and filing IPR-related lawsuits against competitors, many companies nowadays start to appeal to competition laws, preventing their competitors from abusing their market powers.  Thus, it is now absolutely crucial for a company to maintain its edges from the perspective of competition laws in the sophisticated and changing market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Besides, merger control is always one of the major issues in an M&amp;A transaction.  Many high-profile cable system and media M&amp;A deals in Taiwan in recent years directly links to antitrust legal issues.  Particularly, although regulatory system of competition laws differs from one jurisdiction to another, each nation's regulatory agencies work in close collaboration with each other.  Therefore, in a cross-border M&amp;A transaction, cooperation with lawyers from another jurisdiction and a response strategy formulated from a cross-jurisdictional perspective is indispensable.
            </p>
