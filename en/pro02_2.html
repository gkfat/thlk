            <h1>Corporate Governance</h1>
            <p>
              Corporate governance relates to Company Law, Securities Exchange Act and many other laws and regulations.  If managers' business decisions are at odds with relevant laws and regulations, the managers would be exposed to the risks of incurring civil, administrative and even criminal liabilities.  Hence, professional advices provided by corporate lawyers can help managers of a company mitigate such risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, establishing an optimal internal framework is vital for any company seeking to deal effectively with risks that arise in the day-to-day business activities and to promote ongoing corporate expansion.  Through the cooperation with CPAs and other professionals, the experienced corporate lawyers at THLK Partners can help our clients establish a sound internal control and management system which prevents acts of misconduct.
            </p>
            <p>
