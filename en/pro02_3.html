            <h1>Labor &amp; Human Resources</h1>
            <p>
              Management of human resources is one of the most important aspects in the business operation.  Good labor-management relations and personnel policy would enhance the coherence and competitiveness of a company.  On the contrary, if a company deals with labor issues improperly, it would very likely incur monetary and reputational losses and damages.  As labor laws become increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive in Taiwan, in order to control and reduce legal risks, every company should develop a system which conforms to the Taiwan Labor Standard Act and other relevant laws and regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Particularly, in recent years, in order to protect core technologies and competitiveness, many high-tech companies or companies with special know-hows prefer signing &quot;non-compete and confidentiality agreements&quot; with their employees and managers, where the employees and managers are required to keep all trade secrets confidential and prohibited from working for competitors within a specific geographic area during a specified period of time.  In many cases, however, such clauses and contracts turns out to be unenforceable or determined as non-binding by the courts because they were not drafted in ways conforming to the Taiwan laws.  THLK Partners' specialty and substantial experience in labor laws can help our clients draft employment contracts in compliance with relevant laws and accordingly avoid unnecessary disputes and costs in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              In sum, THLK Partners provides the following services in the area of labor and human resources:
            </p>
